# Credit Card Fraud Detection 

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised learning algorithms.

##  Dataset

The dataset used is the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are frauds.

##  Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (RandomForest, LogisticRegression, etc.)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (optional)
- TensorFlow (if used)

##  Model

Trained a machine learning model using RandomForestClassifier to classify transactions as:
- 0 → Not Fraud
- 1 → Fraud

##  Performance

Model evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC

##  How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedhub2005/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
